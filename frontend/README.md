# Frontend (Next.js TypeScript)

This is a minimal Next.js TypeScript frontend scaffolded to work with the serverless API.

Quick start:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The app has a simple API route at `/api/hello` and the index page fetches that route.

.env.local contains NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and should be updated to your API Gateway URL after deployment.
